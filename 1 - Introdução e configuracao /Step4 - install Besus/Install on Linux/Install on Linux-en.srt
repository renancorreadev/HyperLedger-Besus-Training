In this video, we are going to install Hyperledger Besu on Linux.

1
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:12,983
First, we need to install the dependency of Java.

2
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:25,836
I'm using the command 'sudo apt install openjdk-jre-headless', to automatically install Java.

3
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,664
I'll be asked for the password for my Linux instance.

4
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:47,624
An alternative way to do this is to go to the download Java link that is part of the Documentation and download the appropriate version of Java.

5
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:58,155
Once you've done that, you can now download the Besu packaged binaries from the Documentation.

6
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:16,123
We are now going to speed up this next part, but I'm downloading and extracting the packaged binaries into a folder called Code, which we'll come back to in the next step.

7
00:01:22,262 --> 00:01:23,747
Now open up the terminal.

8
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:34,323
The first thing I'm going to do is just make sure that I have the appropriate folder installed.

9
00:01:40,777 --> 00:01:47,031
Now we're going to run the command 'bin/besu --help'.

10
00:01:51,790 --> 00:02:00,576
Before we run that command, I'm going to ensure that we have Java installed by running the command 'java --version'.

11
00:02:01,676 --> 00:02:09,557
Now we're going to change directory to Code and into the installed binaries.

12
00:02:11,224 --> 00:02:15,618
And now we're going to run that command 'bin/besu --help'.

13
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:27,645
If we've installed Besu successfully, we'll get all the options and subcommands that we can run on Hyperledger Besu.

14
00:02:29,113 --> 00:02:31,857
Congrats, we've confirmed we've installed on Linux.
